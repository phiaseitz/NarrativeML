This is a project for coding narratives for themes using ML

I'm using narratives 1-130 for investigation, with 130-164 used for testing later

Also, it's worth noting that you can recieve a score of 1.5 for agency, but the data set has none of that...

Preprocessing:
remove any text in parentheses (because someone added unwanted coded in the narratives)
remove non-alphabet characters except for spaces
fold everything down to lower case
